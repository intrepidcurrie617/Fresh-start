## Areas for Improvement

### 1. Data Persistence
**Current Issue**: Progress is lost on page refresh
**Recommendation**: Implement localStorage to save checkbox states and progress
```javascript
// Example implementation
function saveProgress() {
    const checkboxes = document.querySelectorAll('input[type="checkbox"]');
    const progress = {};
    checkboxes.forEach(cb => {
        progress[cb.id] = cb.checked;
    });
    localStorage.setItem('freshStartProgress', JSON.stringify(progress));
}

function loadProgress() {
    const saved = localStorage.getItem('freshStartProgress');
    if (saved) {
        const progress = JSON.parse(saved);
        Object.keys(progress).forEach(id => {
            const checkbox = document.getElementById(id);
            if (checkbox) checkbox.checked = progress[id];
        });
    }
}
```

### 2. Missing Modal Content
**Current Issue**: Several modals are referenced but not implemented
**Missing Modals**: 
- budgetModal
- housingModal
- applicationModal
- rightsModal
- smartphoneModal
- internetModal
- jobSearchModal

**Recommendation**: Implement all referenced modals with relevant content

### 3. Enhanced Meditation Feature
**Current Issues**: 
- No audio guidance

- Single duration option

**Recommendations**:
- Add different meditation lengths (1, 5, 10, 15 minutes)
- Include breathing pattern guidance
- Add background sounds option
- Implement guided audio (text-to-speech or audio files)

### 4. Accessibility Improvements
**Current Issues**:
- Missing ARIA labels
- No keyboard navigation for tabs
- Limited screen reader support

**Recommendations**:
```html
<!-- Improved tab accessibility -->
<div class="nav-tabs" role="tablist">
    <button class="tab-btn active" 
            role="tab" 
            aria-selected="true" 
            aria-controls="banking"
            id="banking-tab"
            onclick="showTab('banking')">
        Banking & Credit
    </button>
</div>

<div class="tab-content active" 
     id="banking" 
     role="tabpanel" 
     aria-labelledby="banking-tab">
    <!-- content -->
</div>
```

### 5. Form Validation and User Input
**Current Limitation**: No personalization or user input collection
**Recommendations**:
